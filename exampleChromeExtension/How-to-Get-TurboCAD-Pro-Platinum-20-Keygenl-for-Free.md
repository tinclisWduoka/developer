Whether you are working on architectural, mechanical, or civil projects, TurboCAD Pro Platinum 20 can help you create stunning and accurate designs in less time and with less effort.
 
## Drafting Palette
 
The drafting palette is a unique feature of TurboCAD Pro Platinum 20 that allows you to create 2D and 3D objects from a single interface. You can draw lines, arcs, circles, polygons, splines, and more with ease and precision. You can also modify the properties of the objects, such as color, layer, line style, fill style, etc. The drafting palette also supports parametric constraints, which let you control the geometric and dimensional relationships between the objects. For example, you can make two lines parallel, perpendicular, or equal in length. You can also assign dimensions and expressions to the objects to control their size and position.
 
## ACIS Solid Modeling
 
ACIS is a powerful solid modeling engine that enables TurboCAD Pro Platinum 20 to create and edit complex 3D shapes. With ACIS, you can perform advanced operations on solids, such as boolean operations, extrusions, revolutions, sweeps, lofts, shells, fillets, chamfers, etc. You can also convert 2D objects into 3D solids or surfaces with a single click. ACIS also supports smooth surface modeling (SMOOTHMESH), which allows you to create organic shapes with smooth curves and transitions. You can also apply materials and textures to the solids and surfaces to enhance their appearance.
 
## Premium Photorealistic Rendering
 
TurboCAD Pro Platinum 20 comes with a premium photorealistic rendering engine that can produce stunning images of your 3D models. You can choose from various rendering modes, such as wireframe, hidden line, flat shaded, gouraud shaded, phong shaded, etc. You can also adjust the lighting, shadows, reflections, refractions, transparency, fog, depth of field, etc. to create realistic effects. You can also use the LightWorks rendering engine or the RedSDK rendering engine for more options and faster performance. TurboCAD Pro Platinum 20 also supports ray tracing and radiosity rendering techniques for more accurate and detailed results.

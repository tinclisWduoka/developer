## What Can You Do with Simio Personal Edition?
 
Simio Personal Edition allows you to model in 2D and 3D concurrently using intelligent objects from pre-built or custom libraries. You can also access a massive library of freely available 3D symbols from Google Warehouse to add realism to your models. Simio Personal Edition supports both discrete and continuous systems, as well as large-scale applications based on agent-based modeling (ABM). You can freely mix these modeling paradigms within a single model.
 
Some of the features and benefits of Simio Personal Edition are:

- No programming required. You can build models by dragging and placing objects in a graphical interface.
- All-in-one, complete model. You only need a single model for any application, even if it is large-scale or complex.
- Totally accurate portrayal. The simulation software provides an exact model that is the perfect test environment for real-life situations.
- Risk-based planning and scheduling. Simio models can be used to conduct risk analysis and optimize your schedules under uncertainty.
- Digital twin capability. Simio models can be connected to real-time data sources and used as digital twins for monitoring and controlling your systems.
